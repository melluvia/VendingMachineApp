Important Takeaways

+ Using a protocol to model objects makes our design more flexible because we can use any object that conforms to the protocol to suit our design requirements.

+ Using enum values to specify dictionary keys is safer than 'stringly' typed keys because the compiler can verify that the enum value you are using is correctly defined. It cannot do this with a string.

+ A protocol type can be used to specify a type requirement for a class, function parameter or property requirement.

+ To specify that a property requirement in a protocol is a readonly property, you must declare it as gettable only.
